# Movie-Booking-Microservices
This is a microservices-based movie ticket booking application built as a concept-refresh and hands-on learning project for Java Full Stack development.  The main goal of this project is to revise core backend concepts (Spring Boot, REST APIs, JPA, Hibernate) and understand React integration basics, not to build a production-grade system.

Movie Service
- Fetches movies from external TMDB API
- Generates shows
- Provides seat layout metadata
